# Zorin-extra-Layouts
A script which allows anyone to easily switch between some of Zorin's Pro/Ultimate Layouts on Core editions (GNOME, not Lite/XFCE)

This script currently covers **all official Zorin 16 Pro Layouts**

> *This includes some extra layouts and tweaks, such as pop-shell for window Tiling*

> ### **NOTE:** I WILL take this down if the Zorin developers should contact me on that, so don't expect this to stay forever

## How To Use
Basic use:
```
bash -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TGRush/Zorin-extra-Layouts/main/morelayoutsinstall.sh -O -)"
```

## Contributing:
When contributing (or trying to), make sure that you've tested your changes before you make a pull request, and that you relatively know how to use bash and some command line tools (wget for example, unzip, the gnome-extensions cli tool, etc) and that the change you're trying to pull request actually fits the project 

#### Changes which are considered NOT fitting the project:
- untested extensions
- outdated extensions
- changing dconf where unnecessary
- custom extension downloading (already available through extensions.gnome.org on Firefox/Chromium and alike)
- unrevertible changes
