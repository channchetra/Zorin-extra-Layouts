# Zorin-extra-Layouts
A script which allows anyone to easily switch between some of Zorin's Pro/Ultimate Layouts on Core editions (GNOME, not Lite/XFCE)

This script currently covers **all official Zorin 16 Pro Layouts**

> *This includes some extra layouts and tweaks, such as pop-shell for window Tiling*

> ### **NOTE:** I WILL take this down if the Zorin developers should contact me on that, so don't expect this to stay forever
