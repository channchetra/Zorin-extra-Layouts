# Zorin-extra-Layouts
## A script which allows anyone to easily switch between some of Zorin's Pro/Ultimate Layouts on Core editions (GNOME, not Lite/XFCE)
### Note: I WILL take this down if the Zorin developers should contact me on that, so don't expect this to stay forever

This script currently covers the **MacOS-Like Layout**, **Ubuntu-Like Layout**, and **Windows Classic-Like and 11 Layouts**


---

## How To Use
Run this:
```
bash -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TGRush/Zorin-extra-Layouts/main/morelayoutsinstall.sh -O -)"
```

Done.
