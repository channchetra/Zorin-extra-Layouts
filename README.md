# Zorin-extra-Layouts
## A script which allows anyone to easily switch between some of Zorin's Pro/Ultimate Layouts on Core editions (GNOME, not Lite/XFCE)
### Note: I WILL take this down if the Zorin developers should contact me on that, so don't expect this to stay forever

This script currently covers the **MacOS-Like Layout**, others will be added as I become less lazy (or learn how to implement things better, or others contribute, etc)

_**Note that I'm learning how to use bash in scripts through this, so many things can, and likely will be improved (a lot) as I learn**_


## How to use:
first, download/clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/TGRush/Zorin-extra-Layouts.git
```

then simply run the script like this:
```
chmod +x ./morelayoutsinstall.sh && ./morelayoutsinstall.sh
```
The rest is self-explanatory
