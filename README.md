# Zorin-extra-Layouts
## A script which allows anyone to easily switch between some of Zorin's Pro/Ultimate Layouts on Core editions (GNOME, not Lite/XFCE)
### Note: I WILL take this down if the Zorin developers should contact me on that, so don't expect this to stay forever

This script currently covers the **MacOS-Like Layout**, others will be added as I become less lazy

---

## How To Use
Run this:
```
N/A
```

Done.
